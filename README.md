This project has 2 parts to it.
Part 1: SOftware implementation
Part 2: Arduino Uno GUI

# Part 1: Software implementation
The software implementation is just a command line interface of the project built as a proof of concept and a draft before shifting it on a GUI outside of the computer using a microcontroller. It applies the concepts of structs and functions in C++ Programming language to implement a To-do List Manager that is able to add tasks with due dates and priority, edit the same tasks, sort the tasks according to due date or priority based on user input and display them accordingly.

# Part 2: Arduino Uno GUI
Uses an arduino uno and a TFT display screen to interact with the user to create and edit a to-do list manager with various other tasks. It uses concepts of structs and functions in arduino to implement a To-do List Manager that can add tasks, edit them, sort and display them using concepts of data strcutures and algorithms.
